# Geo-Exclusivity Policy

> **Type:** Internal policy — not for external distribution  
> **Status:** Active  
> **Confirmed by:** Danny Dilworth  
> **Date:** February 2026

## The Decision

**DMA (Designated Market Area) is the standard territory unit going forward.**

New clients are sold geo-exclusivity at the DMA level — one PI law firm per DMA. No competing firm in that DMA can become a Lead Faucet client while a firm holds that territory.

## Danny's Direction (Verbatim)

> "Yeah I think it is important to kind of have a clear policy on that. I would suggest that for the website we keep it vague and not over inundate the user with a lot of nuanced information. Maybe we say something to the effect of: we offer per-state, per-DMA, or per-whatever exclusivity depending on the nature of the deal. Then when we're on the sales call, we can kind of get into how that's structured."
>
> "Jacoby-Meyers was the only one that basically wanted the entire state but we can negotiate that."

## Current Active Arrangements

### Jacoby & Meyers — State-Exclusive (Grandfathered)
- **CA, CO, NV, WA** remain state-exclusive for Jacoby & Meyers
- This was a negotiated arrangement for a large anchor client — it is not the default model
- **⚠ To revisit:** When the Jacoby contract comes up for renewal or when we begin actively selling into these states, revisit migrating to per-DMA pricing. The per-state model blocks our ability to sell any other firm in these states regardless of whether Jacoby operates in those markets.

### All Future Clients — DMA Standard
- New clients are sold on a per-DMA basis
- Territory is defined by the Nielsen DMA boundary for their market
- Competitors in the same DMA cannot become Lead Faucet clients while the territory is held

## The Three Product Tiers

### Tier 1 — Standard: Per-DMA Exclusivity
One firm locks one DMA. Pricing by market size:
- **Mega** (LA, NYC, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Miami): $400–$500/lead
- **Large** (SF, San Diego, Tampa, Denver, Phoenix, Seattle): $350–$450/lead
- **Mid/Small/Micro** (Fresno, Bakersfield, Corpus Christi, etc.): $200–$350/lead

### Tier 2 — Bundle: Multi-DMA or Regional
For firms with multiple offices or regional reach — sell them the specific DMAs they operate in, bundled:
- 2–3 DMAs in the same state: 10% discount vs. individual DMA pricing
- All DMAs in a state: 15% discount vs. individual DMA pricing
- Each DMA must be explicitly named in the contract

### Tier 3 — Enterprise: Statewide or Multi-State (Exception Only)
For firms that genuinely run statewide campaigns and want every lead in a state — this exists but is a premium exception, not the standard:
- Priced as the sum of all DMAs in that state, minus a 10–15% bundle discount
- Never a flat per-state fee (avoids the trap of pricing CA and CO identically)
- Minimum 12-month contract; annual review
- Requires explicit approval — this is what we gave Jacoby and we should not repeat it casually

## What to Say on the Website / FAQ

Keep it vague. Do not explain the DMA model in detail publicly. Suggested language:

> "We offer territory-exclusive arrangements — per DMA, per state, or custom — depending on the nature of the deal. One firm per territory, always."

Or for an FAQ:

> "How is your exclusivity structured?"  
> "We offer flexible territory arrangements — by DMA, by state, or custom — based on the size and scope of a firm's market. Our team will walk you through what makes sense for your geography on a call."

---

## What to Say on Sales Calls

This is where you get specific. The discovery question that opens it:

> "Tell me about the markets you operate in. Are you running in one city, a few cities, or statewide?"

From there:
- **Single city / one DMA:** "We'd lock the [City] DMA for you. Here's what that means and what it costs."
- **Multiple cities, same state:** "We'd lock the specific DMAs where you operate. Here's the bundle pricing."
- **Statewide:** "We do offer statewide arrangements, but it's priced as the sum of the DMAs in that state. Let me show you what that looks like for [State]."

**The key distinction to name in every call:**

> "Most lead gen companies sell exclusive leads — meaning they won't sell the same contact twice. We sell exclusive territory — meaning no competing firm in your DMA can buy from us at all. Two firms in the same city can both be Legal Brand Marketing clients. Only one can be a Lead Faucet client."

## Why DMA, Not MSA or ZIP or State

| Unit | Why Not Standard |
|------|-----------------|
| ZIP code | Too granular — PI firms serve full metro areas, not ZIP codes |
| County | Better, but not how attorneys think about their markets |
| MSA | More granular than DMA (382 vs. 210 nationally) but less intuitive to PI attorneys |
| State | Too broad — caps us at 50 clients nationally; blocks markets firm never serves |
| **DMA** | **How PI firms already think about and buy media (TV, radio, CTV, streaming). Published Nielsen map = unambiguous boundaries. 210 markets nationally = real scale.** |

---

## Revenue Ceiling Comparison (Why This Matters)

| Territory Unit | Max US Clients | ARR Ceiling |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| Per State | 50 | $40M–$60M |
| Per DMA | 210 | $84M–$168M |
| Per MSA | 382 | $115M–$248M |

The DMA model opens the revenue ceiling to 2–3x the per-state model while keeping territory language that clients immediately understand.
