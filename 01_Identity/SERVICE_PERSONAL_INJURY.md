# Service Overview: Personal Injury (MVA Focus)

**Last Updated:** February 12, 2026  
**Status:** Active vertical  
**Source:** Integrated from leadfaucet.co + internal positioning

## Service Name

**Personal Injury Demand Infrastructure**

Subtitle: "Predictable case flow for elite PI firms"

---

## What We Provide

### Core Offering

Geo-exclusive MVA lead generation with pre-qualification, real-time delivery, and intake support for personal injury law firms. Territory exclusivity is structured per DMA (Designated Market Area) as the standard — one firm per DMA. Statewide and custom arrangements are available by negotiation.

**Coverage:**
- Motor vehicle accidents (car, motorcycle, truck/semi, rideshare)
- Slip and fall
- Medical malpractice
- Product liability

**Note:** MVA is the highest-volume PI case type and the best-developed within this vertical. Other PI case types (slip and fall, med mal, product liability) are accepted but less prioritized in current creative and tooling.

---

## How It Works (PI-Specific)

### 1. Demand Creation (Geography-Exclusive)

We don't run generic PI ads. We build demand infrastructure within your exclusive territory — defined by DMA (Designated Market Area) as the standard. One firm per DMA. Statewide arrangements available by negotiation.

- **Consumer-facing tools:** CaseSnapshot (AI-assisted MVA documentation tool)
- **Creative campaigns:** Earn attention, don't interrupt (content-first, not ad-first)
- **Brand familiarity:** By the time someone needs help, they've already seen us

**Emotional layer:** We're building awareness for people who need help after the worst moments of their lives—and connecting them to attorneys who can fight back against insurance companies.

### 2. Demand Capture (Qualification at Entry)

We shape who raises their hand:

- **CaseSnapshot** documents the case in 5 minutes (injury details, liability, treatment)
- **Pre-screened qualification:** Injured in accident, not at fault, medical treatment, not represented, within statute
- **Trust before transaction:** By the time they reach your intake, they're calm, qualified, and ready

**Emotional layer:** These aren't "leads." They're people who've been hurt and need someone to fight for them. We make sure they're ready to be helped.

### 3. Demand Qualification (Risk Management)

We reject leads before you have to:

- **92% acceptance rate** — partner firms accept 92 out of 100 leads we deliver
- **Verified injuries** — medical treatment confirmed
- **Liability screening** — not-at-fault determination
- **Statute check** — within filing deadlines
- **No prior representation** — not already signed with another firm

**Rational:** Protects your margins, your time, your trust.  
**Emotional:** So you can focus on the cases that matter—people you can actually help.

### 4. Delivery (Real-Time, Exclusive)

- **Instant delivery** — leads in your inbox within seconds of qualification
- **One firm only** — no bidding wars, no shared leads
- **CaseSnapshot PDF included** — complete documentation from consumer
- **Transparent reporting** — bad weeks reported early, no spin

## Messaging Hooks (Rational + Emotional)

### The Unique Mechanism (Lead With This)

> **"Case-Ready Leads"** — We don't send you leads. We send you cases.

Case-Ready is the standard Lead Faucet holds every lead to, regardless of case type. Better creative attracts real intent. Tighter funnels screen out noise before intake. And at the top of that standard, our proprietary tools — CaseSnapshot for accident victims, GetMyVisa for immigration applicants — where the case is documented before the attorney ever picks up the phone.

**How to use it in conversation:**
> "Most lead gen companies deliver a phone number. We deliver a case — pre-screened, pre-qualified, and in the case of CaseSnapshot and GetMyVisa, pre-documented. Your intake team knows what they're getting before the call begins."

**Important:** Don't position Case-Ready as only applying to tool-generated leads. A soft-tissue lead from a quiz funnel is still Case-Ready — the ads and funnels that produced it are better, so the person who shows up is more real, more intentful, and more qualified than anything a competitor sends.

---

### Rational Hooks (Website)

1. **"Case-Ready Leads for elite PI firms"**
   - Every lead held to the Case-Ready standard — soft tissue through catastrophic
   - Proprietary tools (CaseSnapshot, GetMyVisa) as the proof point of that standard
   - One firm per market
   - 92% acceptance rate
   - $1,600 avg cost per signed case

2. **"The full case spectrum, held to one standard"**
   - Consistent "keep the lights on" volume: soft tissue, minor fractures, general MVA
   - Intentional high-value targeting: rideshare (Uber/Lyft), commercial trucking, TBI, wrongful death
   - Proprietary upstream tools: CaseSnapshot (MVA) and GetMyVisa (immigration)
   - *Additional verticals:* Mass tort — emerging and active MDL cases, high-volume qualification for pharmaceutical, product liability, and corporate harm litigation *(see SERVICE_OTHER_VERTICALS.md)*

3. **"Over-qualification beats volume"**
   - We reject leads before you have to
   - Protecting your margins and your time

### Emotional Hooks (From Positioning Research)

1. **"The rhythm that keeps your practice alive"**
   - Predictable case flow = certainty in a contingency business
   - The Monday morning where you don't check the dashboard twelve times

2. **"We're on your side in the fight"**
   - You're David fighting Goliath (insurance companies)
   - We provide the ammunition to compete with Morgan & Morgan's $240M budget
   - Solo practitioners can compete with unlimited resources

3. **"So you can focus on what matters"**
   - Fighting for people at the worst moments of their lives
   - Not stressing about where next month's cases come from
   - Helping people against billion-dollar insurance companies

### Fused Messaging Examples

**Homepage Hero:**
> "Predictable MVA case flow for elite PI firms. One firm per market. 92% acceptance rate. Because you didn't become a PI attorney to stress about pipeline—you became one to fight for people against insurance companies with unlimited resources."

**Email Campaign:**
> "What if next month's cases were already certain? Geo-exclusive MVA infrastructure. $1,600 per signed case. No bidding wars. The baseline that keeps your practice alive while you focus on the fight that matters."

**Sales Call Opening:**
> "Most lead gen companies sell you contact information. We build demand infrastructure in your exclusive territory. One firm per market. 92% acceptance rate. So you have the certainty you need to focus on what you do best—representing people who can't fight billion-dollar insurance companies alone."

## State-Specific Considerations

### Active Markets (Jacoby & Meyers)
- California
- Colorado
- Nevada
- Washington

### Paused Markets (Think Law)
- North Carolina
- South Carolina
- Georgia
- Mississippi

### State Bar Compliance
See: [`05_Restrictions/State_Bar_Quick_Ref.md`](../05_Restrictions/State_Bar_Quick_Ref.md)

**Critical rules:**
- FCC 2025 consent requirements (one-to-one consent, named entities)
- Third-person language only (never "you" when referencing injury/condition)
- No guarantee of results
- Disclosure that we're not a law firm

---

## Tools & Products

### CaseSnapshot (Live, MVA-Specific)

**What it is:**
> "A free AI-assisted tool for motor vehicle accident victims. Document your case in 5 minutes, download a professional PDF, and share it with your attorney. No signup required."

**Strategic value:**
- Pre-qualifies leads with structured data
- Educates consumers about their case
- Creates trust before intake
- Professional documentation reduces intake time
- "Unfair structural advantage" for partner firms

**Website:** casesnapshot.com

**Emotional framing:**
- Helps people at worst moments get organized
- Empowers them to fight back with documentation
- Makes it easier for attorneys to help them

### Future PI Tools (Planned)

- Slip and fall documentation tool
- Med mal case evaluator
- Product liability intake system

## Competitive Differentiation (PI-Specific)

### What Other PI Lead Gen Companies Do

**Typical model:**
- Sell shared leads to 3-5 firms
- High volume, low quality
- No transparency about lead source
- Blame attorney when leads don't convert
- Generic "qualified MVA leads" positioning

**Language:**
- "Premium MVA leads"
- "Exclusive" (but not really)
- "Real-time delivery" (table stakes)

### What Lead Faucet Does Differently

**Our model:**
- **Case-Ready Leads** — every lead held to a documentation and qualification standard no competitor can match. Proprietary tools (CaseSnapshot, GetMyVisa) are the proof; better ads and funnels are the floor.
- **Full case spectrum** — soft tissue for consistency, high-value targeting (rideshare, trucking, TBI, wrongful death) for upside. Both held to the same Case-Ready standard.
- Geo-exclusive (one firm per market, actually enforced)
- Two-layer system: upstream consumer tools (CaseSnapshot, GetMyVisa) + superior quiz funnels
- Over-qualification beats volume — we reject leads before you have to
- Transparent reporting, bad leads credited
- We help you convert (follow-up intelligence, 60-second response protocol)

**Language:**
- "Case-Ready Leads" not "quality leads"
- "We send cases, not contacts" not "we send leads"
- "Demand infrastructure" not "lead gen"
- "Elite firms" not "all attorneys"
- "Predictable case flow" not "get more leads"
- "We're on your side in the fight" not "buy our leads"

---

## Success Metrics

### Lead Quality Metrics
- 92% acceptance rate (partner firms accept 92/100 leads)
- 10-20% sign rate (industry standard with good follow-up)
- $1,600 average cost per signed case

- **Intake infrastructure:** Dedicated staff, CRM, consistent process

### Business Metrics
- One firm per market (exclusivity maintained)
- Transparent reporting (bad weeks reported early)
