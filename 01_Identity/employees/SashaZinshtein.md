## Professional Bio

Sasha Zinshtein is Chief Growth Officer at Lead Faucet, where he owns both sides of growth: media buying that generates qualified leads, and sales that acquire law firms as partners. He runs the full funnel—from ad spend to signed contracts—and the trust layer that keeps partners long-term.

His media buying runs deep: at **33across**, programmatic account management for 18+ brands (ASOS, Bose, Coach, Diageo, Duracell, Fanatics, Indeed, Mondelez, Pepsico, Tinder, Zalando, and others); at **The Flower Agency**, Director of Growth pioneering cannabis programmatic on Forbes, TripAdvisor, Rolling Stone, Food & Wine when Google and Facebook were off-limits. He scales buyer portfolios, optimizes across DSP/SSP platforms, and tracks ROI end-to-end.

His sales and financial fluency comes from **Riverpoint Capital**: origination, underwriting, and placement of non-dilutive growth capital for SMBs. Millions deployed. He read cash flow, sized risk, and spoke capital-allocator language—which is how he now talks to law firms about case acquisition spend. ROI, payback, allocation. They hear someone who understands their economics, not just their ad budget.

At Lead Faucet: cold outreach, media execution, lead qualification, account relationships, expansion across all markets. 14+ years across programmatic, lead gen, and financial underwriting.

### About Section — Copy-Paste Block (Plain Text)

```
I've spent my career learning how money moves and how attention moves — and turning both into growth.

At 33across I came up through the full stack of programmatic: operations, video, and eventually account management, working with 18+ brands including ASOS, Bose, Coach, Diageo, Fanatics, Mondelez, Pepsico, Tinder, and Zalando. I learned what it takes to place the right message in front of the right audience at scale — and how to optimize until the numbers actually mean something.

At The Flower Agency, I took that into one of the hardest categories in digital marketing. Cannabis brands can't run on Google or Facebook, so we built a different path — programmatic placements on Forbes, TripAdvisor, Rolling Stone, and Food & Wine, with audience segmentation and ROI tracking that gave clients real visibility for the first time.

At Riverpoint Capital, I moved into the financial side — originating, underwriting, and placing non-dilutive growth capital for small businesses. Millions deployed. I learned to read cash flow, size risk, and speak the language of business owners making high-stakes decisions. That experience changed how I sell.

Now as Chief Growth Officer at Lead Faucet, I do both: run the media buying that generates qualified personal injury leads, and drive the sales that brings law firms on as partners. Geo-exclusive — one firm per market, no competition for what we send them.
