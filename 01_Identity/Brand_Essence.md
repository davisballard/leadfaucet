# Brand Essence: Lead Faucet

## What We Are

Lead Faucet is a **lead generation company** specializing in **Motor Vehicle Accident (MVA) personal injury** for law firms. We are NOT a law firm — we are a lead aggregator.

### Focus Area

**Motor Vehicle Accidents ONLY:**
- Car accidents
- Motorcycle accidents  
- Truck/semi accidents
- Rideshare accidents (Uber/Lyft)

We do NOT generate leads for:
- Workplace injuries
- Slip and fall
- Medical malpractice
- Mass torts
- Product liability

### The Business Model
1. Lead Faucet runs its own ad accounts on Meta + Google
2. Ads are *generic* (not attorney-specific) → third-person language only
3. Leads are captured via landing page forms
4. Leads are sold/sent to partner law firms (Jacoby & Meyers, Think Law, etc.)

---

## Mission Statement

Connect accident victims with qualified legal representation quickly and efficiently, while maintaining full regulatory compliance.

---

## Core Values

1. **Compliance First:** We protect the asset (ad accounts) above all. Aggressive but never reckless.
2. **Volume with Quality:** High lead volume that converts for our partner firms.
3. **Speed to Contact:** Get leads to attorneys fast — speed-to-call wins cases.

## Brand Personality

### If Lead Faucet were a person...
- **Demeanor:** Professional, trustworthy, efficient
- **Speaking style:** Clear, authoritative, empathetic to victims
- **Not:** Ambulance-chaser energy, sleazy, exploitative

### Personality Traits
| Trait | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Trustworthy | Feels like a helpful resource, not a trap | "Connect with experienced attorneys" not "Get rich quick" |
| Efficient | Gets to the point, respects user time | Clear forms, fast process |
| Compliant | Professional, legitimate, above-board | All disclosures visible, proper consent |

## Brand Promise

We connect people who've been injured with law firms who can help — quickly, clearly, and with full transparency about who will contact them.

---

## Key Differentiators

1. **We're the connector, not the firm** — Transparent about our role
2. **Compliance-first approach** — Protected ad accounts, clean leads
3. **Multi-firm network** — User chooses who contacts them (FCC 2025 compliant)

---

## What We Are NOT

- We are NOT a law firm
- We are NOT providing legal advice
- We are NOT recommending specific attorneys
- We DO NOT use "you" language for injuries/conditions
