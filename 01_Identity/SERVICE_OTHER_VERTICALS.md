## Overview

Lead Faucet applies the same demand infrastructure model to three legal verticals — each one a practice area the team has gone deep on, with dedicated tools, screening criteria, and creative strategy built for it specifically.

1. **Personal Injury** — see SERVICE_PERSONAL_INJURY.md
2. **Immigration** — documented here
3. **Mass Tort** — documented here

**From website:** "The system is vertical-agnostic. Our expertise is not."

Each vertical gets:
- Dedicated creative and messaging
- Specialized qualification criteria
- Vertical-specific intake expertise
- Proprietary consumer tools

## Immigration Services

### Tagline
"Qualified immigration demand, delivered."

### What We Provide

- Family petitions
- Employment visas
- Asylum
- Naturalization
- Multi-language intake across 12 visa categories

### Service Description (from website)

> "Family petitions, employment visas, asylum, naturalization. Multi-language intake across 12 visa categories."

### Geo-Exclusive Model

Same as PI:
- One firm per market
- No shared leads
- Exclusive territory lock
- Predictable case flow

### Tool

**GetMyVisa** (getmyvisa.co) — Live. Multi-language guided intake experience for immigration applicants. Covers 12 visa categories including family petitions, employment visas, asylum, and naturalization. Applicants are pre-qualified and documented before attorney contact begins.

**Philosophy:** Same as CaseSnapshot — free consumer-facing tools that educate, qualify, and document before intake.

### Target Customer

**Immigration law firms that:**
- Handle multiple visa categories
- Have multilingual intake capability
- Want predictable case flow
- Accept geo-exclusivity
- Think strategically about lead generation

## Mass Tort Services

### Tagline
"High-volume qualification for complex litigation."

### What We Provide

**Coverage:**
- Emerging mass torts
- Active mass torts
- High-volume qualification systems
- Complex, multi-district litigation support

### Service Description (from website)

> "Emerging and active mass torts. High-volume qualification systems for complex, multi-district litigation."

### Geo-Exclusive Model

Adapted for mass tort economics:
- May work with multiple firms (mass torts often need volume)
- Still qualification-focused
- High-volume systems
- Predictable lead flow

### Tools (Coming Soon)

Mass tort intake tools in development.

**Philosophy:** Qualify at scale for complex litigation.

### Target Customer

**Mass tort firms that:**
- Handle MDL cases
- Need high-volume qualification
- Can process cases at scale
- Want consistent flow of qualified claimants

## Practice Area Overview

### Personal Injury (MVA)
The most fully built-out vertical in terms of tooling, research, and partner relationships. CaseSnapshot is live. Partners include Jacoby & Meyers and Larry H. Parker. Highest volume case type. See `SERVICE_PERSONAL_INJURY.md` for full documentation.

### Immigration
GetMyVisa is the dedicated consumer tool — multi-language guided intake across 12 visa categories. Partner firms handle family petitions, employment visas, asylum, and naturalization. Geo-exclusive model applies.

### Mass Tort
High-volume qualification for MDL litigation — pharmaceutical, product liability, corporate harm. Mass tort economics differ from PI (exclusivity may be adapted for volume needs). Tools in development.

## Consistent Positioning Across All Verticals

### Rational Core (Same for All)

- Geo-exclusive model
- "Demand infrastructure" not "leads"
- Elite firm positioning
- Over-qualification beats volume
- Transparent reporting
- Proprietary consumer tools

### Emotional Layer (Adapted by Vertical)

**Personal Injury:**
- Fighting insurance companies
- Helping people at worst moments
- David vs. Goliath resource asymmetry

**Immigration:**
- Helping families reunite
- Navigating complex systems
- Building new futures in America

**Mass Tort:**
- Taking on pharmaceutical companies and corporations
- Representing hundreds/thousands harmed
- Class-action justice at scale

**All verticals share:** Lawyers as advocates, firms as strategic partners, focus on cases that matter.
