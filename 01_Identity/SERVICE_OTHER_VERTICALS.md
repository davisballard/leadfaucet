# Service Overview: Other Verticals (Immigration & Mass Tort)

**Last Updated:** February 12, 2026  
**Status:** Secondary verticals (documented, not prioritized)

## Overview

Lead Faucet applies the same demand infrastructure model to three legal verticals:

1. **Personal Injury** (PRIMARY — see SERVICE_PERSONAL_INJURY.md)
2. **Immigration** (SECONDARY — documented here)
3. **Mass Tort** (SECONDARY — documented here)

**From website:** "The system is vertical-agnostic. Our expertise is not."

Each vertical gets:
- Dedicated creative and messaging
- Specialized qualification criteria
- Vertical-specific intake expertise
- Proprietary consumer tools

### Service Description (from website)

- Complex, multi-district litigation support

### Service Description (from website)

> "Emerging and active mass torts. High-volume qualification systems for complex, multi-district litigation."

### Geo-Exclusive Model

- May work with multiple firms (mass torts often need volume)

- High-volume systems
- Predictable lead flow

### Tools (Coming Soon)

Mass tort intake tools in development.

**Philosophy:** Qualify at scale for complex litigation.

## Service Hierarchy

### Primary Focus: Personal Injury (MVA)

**Why PI is primary:**
- Highest volume potential
- Most predictable economics
- Clearest qualification criteria
- Proven tools (CaseSnapshot live)
- Established partner base (Jacoby & Meyers, Larry H. Parker)
- Most research and strategy developed

**Current priority:** 90% of effort on PI/MVA

### Secondary Verticals: Immigration & Mass Tort

**Status:** Offered, but not prioritized for current brand documentation work.

**Why secondary:**
- Smaller current client base
- Tools still in development
- Less research completed
- Different economics and qualification models

**Approach:**
- Document what's on website
- Don't create extensive strategy docs yet
- Maintain positioning consistency
- Revisit when these verticals scale

---

## Consistent Positioning Across All Verticals

### Rational Core (Same for All)

- Geo-exclusive model
- "Demand infrastructure" not "leads"
- Elite firm positioning
- Over-qualification beats volume
- Transparent reporting
- Proprietary consumer tools

### Emotional Layer (Adapted by Vertical)

**Personal Injury:**
- Fighting insurance companies
- Helping people at worst moments
- David vs. Goliath resource asymmetry

**Immigration:**
- Helping families reunite
- Navigating complex systems
- Building new futures in America

**Mass Tort:**
- Taking on pharmaceutical companies and corporations
- Representing hundreds/thousands harmed
- Class-action justice at scale

**All verticals share:** Lawyers as advocates, firms as strategic partners, focus on cases that matter.
