## Key Insights

### Path to Growth

1. **Phase 1 (Current):** Build consistent volume with bought leads at $250
   - Target: 1-2 leads/day/state with Jacoby & Meyers
   - Annual target: $288k-$576k

2. **Phase 2 (Near-term):** Reactivate Think Law, scale to 8 states
   - Target: 2 leads/day/state across both clients
   - Annual target: $576k

3. **Phase 3 (Own Lead Generation):** Begin generating own leads at $150
   - Even 25% own leads increases profit by 25%
   - 50/50 mix doubles the profit potential

4. **Phase 4 (Optimization):** Scale own lead generation to $100/lead
   - Maximum profit margin: $250/lead
   - Ultimate annual potential at 3 leads/day/state: **$2.16M** (each partner: **$648k/year**)

### Strategic Priorities

- **Volume first:** Establish consistent 2 leads/day/state baseline with bought leads
- **Quality maintenance:** Ensure client satisfaction to sustain purchasing patterns
- **Own lead development:** Invest in infrastructure to generate leads at $150, then optimize to $100
- **Client diversification:** Two active clients (J&M + Think Law) reduces dependency risk
