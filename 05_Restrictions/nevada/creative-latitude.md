# Nevada Creative Latitude Guide
## What You CAN Do in Nevada That You CANNOT Do in California

> **Saul:** "This is your 'push it' playbook for Nevada. Everything in here is something California SB37 blocks but Nevada allows. When you're building Nevada campaigns, this is where you find the edge."
>
> **Client:** Jacoby & Meyers
> **State:** Nevada (Las Vegas metro primary)

## 1. THE BIG PICTURE: NEVADA LATITUDE

### Why Nevada Is Different

**California SB37** (2022 legislation) imposed significant restrictions on personal injury advertising:
- No crash footage
- No specific settlement amount promises
- No "get more than first offer" framing
- "Trusted advisor" tone mandated

**Nevada has no equivalent legislation.**

This creates real creative latitude for Nevada campaigns that you cannot use in California, Colorado, or Washington (where J&M also operates).

## 2. VISUAL CREATIVE: WHAT'S UNLOCKED

### Crash Footage

| Element | Nevada | California | Risk Rating |
|---------|--------|------------|-------------|
| Real crash footage | ✅ Permitted | ❌ Banned (SB37) | ⭐⭐ Low (state) |
| Dashcam footage | ✅ Permitted | ❌ Banned | ⭐⭐ Low (state) |
| Simulated crashes | ✅ With disclosure | ❌ Banned | ⭐⭐ Low (state) |
| Crash aftermath | ✅ Permitted | ⚠️ Cautious | ⭐⭐ Low (state) |

> **Saul:** "You can open with dashcam footage of a T-bone in Nevada. In California, that's a non-starter. Just remember — Meta still has sensationalism rules. Context matters."

**Best Practices for Crash Footage:**
- Use as hook (first 3 seconds) then transition to attorney/education
- Avoid gratuitous gore or distress
- No visible blood or severe injury
- Transition to positive (recovery, resolution, justice)

**Example Usage:**
```
[0:00-0:02] Dashcam: Car runs red light, collision
[0:02-0:03] Freeze frame, text overlay: "This happens every day in Vegas."
[0:03-0:15] Attorney speaking, educational content
[0:15-0:30] Solution, CTA
```

### Settlement Check Imagery

| Element | Nevada | California | Risk Rating |
|---------|--------|------------|-------------|
| Settlement check visuals | ✅ Permitted | ❌ Restricted (SB37) | ⭐⭐ Low |
| Specific dollar amounts | ✅ With disclaimer | ❌ Restricted | ⭐⭐⭐ Medium |
| "Before/After" comparisons | ✅ With disclaimer | ❌ Banned | ⭐⭐⭐ Medium |

**Best Practices:**
- Blur client name on checks (privacy)
- Include "Past results do not guarantee future outcomes" disclaimer
- Use as proof of results, not promise of results

### Injury Imagery

| Element | Nevada | California | Platform Risk |
|---------|--------|------------|---------------|
| Cast/crutches (recovery) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ⭐ Low |
| Bruises (minor) | ⚠️ Caution | ❌ Avoid | ⭐⭐⭐ Medium |
| Bandages/slings | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Cautious | ⭐⭐ Low |
| Hospital beds | ⚠️ Caution | ❌ Avoid | ⭐⭐⭐ Medium |
| Gore/blood | ❌ No | ❌ No | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ High |

> **Saul:** "Nevada gives you more room, but Meta's still watching. Show the recovery, not the trauma. Cast with signatures? Good. Open wound? Dead on arrival."

---

## 3. COPY LATITUDE: WHAT'S UNLOCKED

### Settlement Amount Claims

**California SB37 Restricts:** Specific dollar claims, "get more" framing
**Nevada Allows:** Direct settlement claims with disclaimer

| Claim Type | Nevada | California | Example |
|------------|--------|------------|---------|
| Aggregate totals | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Cautious | "$500M recovered" |
| Case-specific amounts | ✅ With disclaimer | ❌ Restricted | "$1.2M settlement" |
| "More than first offer" | ✅ With disclaimer | ❌ Banned | "10x what insurance offered" |
| Before/after comparison | ✅ With disclaimer | ❌ Banned | "$5K offer → $150K result" |

**Nevada-Approved Examples:**

✅ **Aggregate:**
> "Our attorneys have recovered over $500 million for accident victims across Nevada."

✅ **Case-Specific:**
> "Recent verdict: $1.2 million for Las Vegas rear-end collision victim."

✅ **Comparison:**
> "Insurance offered $5,000. After we got involved: $175,000."

**Required Disclaimer (ALWAYS):**
> "Past results do not guarantee future outcomes. Each case is unique."

### "Fighter" Positioning

**California SB37 Encourages:** "Trusted advisor" tone
**Nevada Allows:** Aggressive "fighter" positioning

| Tone Element | Nevada | California |
|--------------|--------|------------|
| "Fight back" language | ✅ Yes | ❌ Avoid |
| Anti-insurance framing | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Soft |
| Accusatory language | ✅ Yes | ❌ Avoid |
| Aggressive CTAs | ✅ Yes | ❌ Avoid |

**Nevada-Approved Examples:**

✅ **Fighter Positioning:**
> "Insurance companies have teams of lawyers working against you. It's time you fight back."

✅ **Anti-Insurance:**
> "Their adjusters are trained to lowball you. Ours are trained to get you what you deserve."

✅ **Aggressive CTA:**
> "Stop letting insurance win. Get your money."

**California Would Require:**
> "Connect with experienced attorneys who can help you understand your options."

### Urgency Language

**California SB37 Prefers:** Soft urgency, educational tone
**Nevada Allows:** Direct urgency

| Urgency Type | Nevada | California |
|--------------|--------|------------|
| "Don't wait" | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Soft |
| "Time is running out" | ✅ Yes | ❌ Avoid |
| "Call now" | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Soft |
| Direct deadline language | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Soft |

**Nevada-Approved:**
> "Don't wait another day. Evidence disappears. Witnesses forget. The clock is ticking."

**California-Compliant:**
> "Statutes of limitations may affect your legal options. Consider speaking with an attorney."

## 4. TONE & POSITIONING: WHAT'S UNLOCKED

    understand your options"                   Make them pay."
```

## 5. "PUSH IT" TACTICS: RISK-RATED

| Specific settlement amounts | ⭐⭐⭐ Medium | Requires disclaimer |
| "More than first offer" claims | ⭐⭐⭐ Medium | Requires disclaimer |

| Fighter positioning | ⭐⭐ Low | State OK |
| Anti-insurance framing | ⭐⭐ Low | State OK |
| Aggressive urgency | ⭐⭐ Low | State OK |

### High-Reward "Push It" Combinations

```
[Dashcam crash footage]
"This happens every day in Vegas."
"That's why we've recovered over $500 million for accident victims."
"Get what you're owed. Link in bio."
[Disclaimer: Past results do not guarantee future outcomes]
```

**Combo 2: Before/After + Fighter**
```
"Insurance offered my client $5,000."

"Your case won't wait. Neither should you."
[Disclaimer: Past results do not guarantee future outcomes]

```

## 6. PLATFORM LIMITS (STILL APPLY)

> **Saul:** "Nevada says yes. But Meta and Google still have to say yes too. Here's what still kills you."

### Still Banned (Platform Policy, Not State)

| Element | Why It's Banned | Risk Level |
|---------|-----------------|------------|
| "You" + injury/pain | Meta Personal Attributes | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Ban |
| Gore/blood/graphic injury | Meta Sensational Content | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Ban |
| Distressed faces at camera | Meta Personal Attributes | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High |
| "You were hurt" | Personal Attribute | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Ban |
| False urgency ("Limited time!") | Meta Scam Signals | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High |

### The Nevada + Platform Sweet Spot

| Nevada Allows | Platform Allows | Result |
|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| Crash footage | Non-gratuitous | ✅ Use it |
| Settlement amounts | With disclaimers | ✅ Use it |
| Fighter tone | Third-person | ✅ Use it |
| Anti-insurance | Non-defamatory | ✅ Use it |
| Urgency | Factual basis | ✅ Use it |

> **Saul:** "The golden rule still applies: third person. 'Accident victims in Nevada may be entitled...' not 'Were you hurt in a crash?' Nevada lets you be aggressive — but not stupid."

> - Crash footage (the hook that California took away)
> - Specific settlement numbers (with disclaimer)
> - Fighter positioning (not trusted advisor)
> - Direct urgency (not soft suggestions)
> - Anti-insurance framing (call out the bad guys)
>
> **What you still don't have:**
> - 'You were injured' language (platform ban)
> - Gore/blood (platform ban)
> - Guarantees (state + platform ban)
> - Fake urgency (platform ban)
>
> **The play:**
> Push it in Nevada. Use the latitude. But remember — you're still running on Meta/Google. 
> State says yes AND platform says yes = go.
> Either one says no = stop.
>
> Now go make some money. Legally."
