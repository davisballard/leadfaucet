#### Body Copy (Paragraphs)

1. TAP A DROPLET

2. EXCLUSIVE DEMAND INFRASTRUCTURE FOR LEGAL

3. We build geo-exclusive demand infrastructure that controls, captures, and qualifies legal demand for elite law firms. Predictable case flow. Controlled risk. One firm per market.

4. GEO-EXCLUSIVE MODEL

5. When you partner with Lead Faucet, you own your geography. Every qualified case opportunity in your market flows exclusively to your firm. No bidding wars. No shared intake. Once your market is locked, it's locked.

6. HOW IT WORKS

7. We don't run ads. We occupy attention within your exclusive geography — building brand familiarity and demand saturation through creative systems that earn attention.

8. We shape who raises their hand and how informed they are. Trust before transaction. By the time someone reaches intake, they're calm, qualified, and ready.

9. Qualification is risk management. We reject leads before you have to — protecting your margins, your trust, and your long-term economics.

10. Transparent reporting, consistent communication, and data that beats spin. Bad weeks reported early. No surprises. Operational dependency, not vendor dependency.

11. PRODUCTS

12. Lead Faucet develops proprietary, consumer-facing tools that serve the public for free — and give partner firms an unfair structural advantage. These tools educate, qualify, and document before a claimant ever reaches intake.

13. A free AI-assisted tool for motor vehicle accident victims. Document your case in 5 minutes, download a professional PDF, and share it with your attorney. No signup required.

14. Immigration and mass tort intake tools

15. Same philosophy. Different verticals. Exclusive to partner firms.

16. VERTICALS

17. We apply the same demand infrastructure to every vertical we enter — but we only enter verticals where we can build genuine depth. Each practice area gets dedicated creative, qualification criteria, and intake expertise.

18. MVA, slip and fall, med mal, product liability. Pre-qualified claimants with verified injuries, exclusive to your market.

19. Family petitions, employment visas, asylum, naturalization. Multi-language intake across 12 visa categories.

20. Emerging and active mass torts. High-volume qualification systems for complex, multi-district litigation.

21. WHO WE WORK WITH

22. Scarcity is strategic. We keep our client roster small so every account gets the infrastructure, attention, and exclusivity it deserves.

23. LIMITED AVAILABILITY

24. Once a geography is locked to a partner, it stays locked. Check if your market is available.

25. Geo-exclusive demand infrastructure for elite law firms.

26. NAVIGATION

27. LEGAL

WHO WE WORK WITH

We don't work with every firm.

Scarcity is strategic. We keep our client roster small so every account gets the infrastructure, attention, and exclusivity it deserves.

We partner with firms that
Already invest in lead generation
Have intake infrastructure in place
Want predictability over hype
Accept geo-exclusivity terms
Think in terms of cost per signed case, not cost per lead
We don't work with
Price shoppers looking for the cheapest CPL
Firms without intake discipline
Anyone who treats leads as a commodity

LIMITED AVAILABILITY

Claim your market
before someone else does.

Once a geography is locked to a partner, it stays locked. Check if your market is available.
