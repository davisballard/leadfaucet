# Geo-Exclusivity Territory Model: Per-State vs. Per-Metro

> **For:** Danny  
> **From:** Davis  
> **Purpose:** Clarify how geo-exclusivity should be defined and priced for multi-location law firms — and align on the right commercial model before we scale outreach

## The Problem We Need to Solve

Right now, geo-exclusivity isn't clearly defined for multi-location firms. Jacoby & Meyers gets whole-state exclusivity (CA, CO, NV, WA) — one contract, one firm, entire state locked. That model made sense to close a large anchor client, but we're now reaching out to firms that span multiple cities and multiple states, and the question isn't answered:

**If a law firm has offices in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego — do they get all of California? Just those three metros? Something else? And what do we charge?**

This needs to be settled before we scale outreach, because we're going to get this question constantly from larger prospects, and our answer determines both our revenue ceiling and our competitive positioning.

## The Core Question

> **How do we define geo-exclusivity for multi-location firms — and are we doing it per state or per metro area?**

Specifically:

1. **What is the unit of exclusivity right now?** Is it a state? A metro area? A territory we define per deal?

2. **For multi-location firms:** If a firm has offices in 3 cities in the same state, do they get the entire state? Just the metros where they have offices? Something in between?

3. **For multi-state firms:** If a firm operates in 5 states, are they buying 5 state-wide exclusivities? 5 metro exclusivities? Do we bundle it? Is there a different product for them entirely?

4. **Is the Jacoby model (whole-state) the standard, or was that a one-off deal for a large anchor client?** If it's the standard, we need to understand what that does to our ability to sell other firms in the same state.

5. **What should the pricing structure look like?** Per metro? Per state? Bundled? Tiered?

## What's at Stake

This isn't just a pricing question — it determines how many clients we can actually take in any given market.

**Example: California**  
California has 25 distinct metro areas (LA, SF, San Diego, Sacramento, Riverside, Fresno, etc.) with a combined ARR potential of $12.5M–$20M if we monetize each metro separately.

- **If we sell California whole-state to one firm (Jacoby model):** We're capped at 1 client for all of California. We can't sell a San Diego firm, a Sacramento firm, or a San Jose firm even if Jacoby doesn't operate there.
- **If we sell metro-by-metro:** We could have 25 clients across California, each owning their market.

That's the difference between $800K ARR from one client and $12M+ ARR from 25 clients in the same state.

## Pros & Cons: Per-State vs. Per-Metro

### Per-State Model (Current Jacoby Approach)

**Pros:**
- Simple to pitch and explain — law firms think in state terms (licensed by state, advertise by state)
- Appeals to large regional firms who operate statewide and want total coverage
- One contract, one relationship, easier to manage
- Revenue concentration: one large deal vs. many small ones
- State lines are legally clear — no ambiguity about what "California" means
- Harder for the client to complain about territory overlap (they own everything)

**Cons:**
- **Massive opportunity cost.** A state-wide lock blocks us from selling every other firm in that state — including ones Jacoby may not even serve. If Jacoby doesn't actively advertise in Sacramento, we still can't sell a Sacramento firm.
- **Underpriced for what it delivers.** The 25 California metros combined represent our highest revenue potential in the country. Pricing this as one deal — even at a premium — likely leaves money on the table.
- **No relationship to actual service area.** A firm with offices in LA and SF doesn't serve Fresno or Redding. Why are we blocking those metros for a firm that will never serve them?
- **Huge state variation goes unpunished.** California (40M people, 25 metros) vs. Colorado (5.9M people, ~3 major metros) are completely different in market size, but a per-state model treats them the same.
- **Creates a scaling ceiling early.** If all our large clients buy state-wide, we're capped at 50 clients nationally (one per state) — nowhere near the $100M+ ARR opportunity of the metro model.
- **Sets a precedent we'll regret.** Every future large prospect will expect the same deal.

---

### Per-Metro Model (What Our Own Analysis Points To)

**Pros:**
- **Unlocks the real revenue ceiling.** 382 metros nationally vs. 50 states. The whale model projects $50–$97M ARR from top 150 metros — that number collapses if we're capping at one client per state.
- **Aligns with how PI attorneys actually operate.** A firm advertises in specific DMAs, not whole states. Geo-exclusive by metro matches how they think about territory.
- **Fair to the client.** They pay for what they actually want and use — not a whole state they'll never fully serve.
- **Lets us monetize the rest of the state.** A Dallas firm gets Dallas. A Houston firm gets Houston. We sell both.
- **Cleaner pricing logic.** Price tiers by metro population and market activity (Tier 1–5 model). LA is not the same as Fresno. Per-metro pricing reflects reality.
- **More defensible long-term.** If we define exclusivity tightly (metro/MSA boundary), we can defend it. Selling "California" to a firm and then having a client complain we sold San Diego to someone else is a mess.

**Cons:**
- **Harder to pitch to large regional firms.** A firm used to thinking statewide may push back — "I don't just want LA, I want all of California."
- **More contract complexity.** Need to define metro boundaries clearly (what MSA does our "LA territory" cover? Does it include the Inland Empire?)
- **Could feel like nickel-and-diming.** If a firm with 4 California offices has to buy 4 separate metro contracts, that's a different conversation than one state deal.
- **Longer sales process for big clients.** Instead of "here's your state," it becomes "here's your metro bundle — let's figure out which ones you want."
- **Enforcement complexity.** Where one metro ends and another begins can be contested by a client ("our firm serves clients from LA to San Bernardino — who exactly is in our territory?").

## The Multi-Location Firm Scenarios We Need Answers For

### Scenario A: Multi-City, Same State
*Example: Firm with offices in LA, San Francisco, and San Diego*

Options:
1. **Sell them 3 metros.** They get LA + SF + San Diego, charged per metro. We can still sell Sacramento, Riverside, Fresno, etc. to other firms.
2. **Sell them a state.** They get all of California. We collect a large single deal but block 22 other metros.
3. **Sell them a regional bundle.** Offer "SoCal" (LA + SD + Inland Empire) and "NorCal" (SF + Bay Area) as bundled packages at a discount. Fresno and Sacramento remain open.

**The right answer is probably Option 1 or 3.**

---

### Scenario B: Multi-State Firm
*Example: Firm with offices in CA, TX, FL, NY, and IL*

Options:
1. **Per metro in each state.** They buy their specific metros — LA, Dallas, Miami, NYC, Chicago. Everything else stays open.
2. **Per state, 5 states.** They get all 5 states locked. That's potentially $44M+ in ARR potential we're giving to one firm.
3. **Custom multi-state package.** Negotiate a bundle — they get exclusivity in their primary metros across states, with a premium pricing tier for national reach.

**This is where we need a clear answer. A firm like Morgan & Morgan will want national exclusivity. What's our offer?**

---

### Scenario C: Large Statewide Advertiser (The Jacoby Model)
*Example: A firm that genuinely runs statewide campaigns and wants every lead in the state*

For firms that actually operate statewide (statewide TV, radio, billboard), per-state may be the right product — but it needs to be **priced accordingly** to reflect that we're locking an entire state.

- A California state-wide exclusivity should not be the same price as a metro deal. It should reflect the full ARR potential of all 25 California metros.
- **Recommended pricing logic:** State-wide = sum of top 5–10 metros in that state (since that's where the volume lives), not a flat fee.

---

## Suggested Framework

**The Standard Product: Per-Metro Exclusivity**

One firm per metro area (MSA boundary). Pricing tiers by market size:
- Tier 1 (Mega — LA, NYC, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Miami): $400–$500/lead
- Tier 2 (Large — SF, San Diego, Tampa, Denver, Phoenix, etc.): $350–$450/lead
- Tier 3–5 (Mid/Small/Micro): $200–$350/lead

**The Bundle Product: Regional or State Exclusivity**

For firms that want multiple metros, offer bundled pricing:
- "SoCal Bundle" (LA + SD + Inland Empire): 15% discount off individual metro pricing
- "State-wide Coverage" (All metros in a state): Premium — priced at the aggregate value of top metros, not a flat state fee
- "Multi-State" (National firms): Custom enterprise pricing — each state treated as a bundle

**The Enterprise Exception: Statewide/National at Premium Pricing**

For firms like Jacoby who want true statewide exclusivity — this is a premium product, not the standard. Priced at:
- Value of top 5–8 metros in that state (since that's where the volume actually comes from)
- Minimum commitment proportionate to state size
- Annual contract, with review of volume delivery by metro

---

## What We Need to Align On

1. **Is per-state or per-metro the default going forward?**

2. **What does Jacoby's contract actually say?** Are they paying for "California" as a state, or for the specific metros where they run? This matters a lot for how we handle other California prospects.

3. **If a multi-location firm wants metros where they have offices plus adjacent markets — is that a bundle we offer, or do we sell individual metros?**

4. **Do we grandfather Jacoby's model or eventually migrate them to metro-based pricing?**

5. **What's the answer when a prospect says "I want the whole state"?** Is that a product we offer, and at what price?

## Who Should Be in This Conversation

**Danny** — He's set the Jacoby precedent and is closest to how these deals have been structured. His view on commercial intent matters most here.

**Sasha** — He's on the frontlines of outreach and will hit this question daily. He needs a crisp answer he can deliver on cold calls and discovery.

**A legal/contracts perspective** — Before we finalize how we define metro territories, we need clean MSA boundary definitions in our contracts. A confused client who thinks their "LA exclusivity" covers Pasadena but we sold Pasadena to someone else is a relationship problem.

**Competitive reference** — Worth a quick scan of how iLawyer, Legal Brand Marketing, Taqtics, and Ngage define geo-exclusivity in their contracts. Knowing the industry standard arms us in the conversation.

---

## The Recommended Position

**Move to metro-based exclusivity as the standard.**

The per-state model was the right move to land Jacoby fast. But it's not the scalable model — it caps our revenue ceiling at 50 clients nationally when the real opportunity is 150–382 metro clients.

For multi-location firms: sell them the metros they actually operate in, with bundled pricing as an upsell. For firms that genuinely want statewide coverage, offer it at a price that reflects the full value of locking that state — not as a standard deal.

The goal: every time a large firm says "I want all of California," the answer is "Great — here's what statewide coverage costs and what it includes," not "Sure, same price as a metro deal."
