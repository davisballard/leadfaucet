## Decisions Made

### Priority Focus: Jacoby & Myers First
- **Decision:** Keep Jacoby & Myers happy and get leads flowing before expanding
- **Made by:** Danny
- **Rationale:** They're the active client; Think Law campaigns are paused
- **Implication:** All creative development should prioritize J&M states and compliance

### Creative Split: 80/20 Approach
- **Decision:** 80% of creative within proven formats, 20% novel/experimental
- **Made by:** Mutual agreement
- **Rationale:** Need to keep what works while testing new approaches
- **Implication:** Can explore humor and unconventional content within the 20%

### Platform Expansion: TikTok is Underutilized
- **Decision:** TikTok represents significant opportunity; competitors aren't playing there
- **Made by:** Mutual agreement
- **Rationale:** "The rest of the industry is not really playing there... these people are dinosaurs"
- **Implication:** Funny ads and UGC could crush on TikTok; organic reach potential

### Landing Page Approach: Quiz Funnel
- **Decision:** Multi-step questionnaire is the way to go
- **Made by:** Danny (industry consensus)
- **Rationale:** Industry standard, but opportunity to differentiate with language and value
- **Implication:** Focus on optimizing existing Hayflow quiz funnels rather than rebuilding

### Geographic Targeting Only
- **Decision:** Special ad category restricts targeting to geography only
- **Made by:** Platform requirement
- **Rationale:** Can't target age or interests; only geo down to 5-15 mile level
- **Implication:** Creative must work broadly; can't micro-target demographics

## Ideas and Concepts

### Value-First Positioning: "Accident Advocate"
> "My big swing for the fences is how to become an advocate for the victim and give them free tools and while still capturing their lead information... draw them in by actually giving value."
> — Danny

**Reactions:** Davis responded positively, noted this aligns with informative/helpful content performing on TikTok  
**Status:** Approved Direction — Hypothesis to test

### Case Builder Pro Tool
> "Organize your motor vehicle accident details in a professional case packet that any law firm can use. Save time, review stress, never retell your story."
> — Danny

**Concept:** Free tool that guides victims through documenting their accident, generates a PDF case file, with lead capture embedded in the flow. Qualifiers/disqualifiers are baked into the experience invisibly.  
**Status:** Built and demonstrated — ready for testing

### Case Strength Score Tool
> "This one is giving you a case-strength score... it's not telling you how much you can make."
> — Danny

**Concept:** Real-time score that updates as user provides details. Avoids legal issues of promising settlement amounts. Concern raised: if score shown before lead capture, what's the incentive to submit info?  
**Status:** Built — needs optimization (possibly blur score until submission)

### Conversion Hypothesis: Value = +10%
> "By providing value more of use, I suspect that I will be able to increase conversion on the landing page by 10 percent."
> — Danny

**Status:** Hypothesis to test

### Humor Hypothesis: Attention = Conversion
> "By creating something that's humorous and scroll-stopping but still has the same message as competitors B&C, I will get more attention and convert more low traffic."
> — Danny

**Status:** Approved for testing — Danny shared Bigfoot ad, "Kanye" ad examples with high click-through rates

### Atypical Faces Perform Better
> "They said they respond best to atypical faces... something that's not like perfect... I'm very interested to be like all right what is like an attractive woman in Seattle look like but make her like you know so good looking but like you know a little bit imperfect in some way."
> — Davis

**Status:** Explore Further — interesting creative hypothesis for AI-generated avatars

### Insurance Companies as Villains
> "Are there any like essentially like villains in the story we can have... the villain was obviously the insurance company."
> — Davis

**Reactions:** Danny: "That's where we're gonna have to beat our compliance engine"  
**Status:** Explore with caution — must run through compliance check

### Iterative AI Learning System
> "Every piece of content we do we're iteratively learning on... there's somewhere that all the good ad copy goes in with all the different metrics attached to it and then we're able to spin off copy from that."
> — Davis

**Reactions:** Danny loved this concept  
**Status:** Davis is building this — recursive loop of learning

---

## Stakeholder Positions

### Danny (Lead Faucet)
> "I don't think we're in the business of trusting this tool to do that... we are it's always to like create the ad creative outside of this tool and then let it... just use this algorithm to optimize the ad spend."

> "The most important thing is that we're calling out our avatar meaning like we're very explicit who the ad is for but beyond that you could be as outlandish as you want."

> "The most important thing is uh as much as we can up front calling out our avatar... pattern interrupt in the first three seconds."

- **Wants:** Novel creative that differentiates from "dog shit" industry templates; compliance-safe but edgy content; systematic learning from every ad dollar spent
- **Likes:** Davis's AI system approach; humor and outlandish content; value-first positioning; the Bigfoot ad style
- **Dislikes:** Generic red-text-on-yellow-background industry templates; giving money to third-party campaign managers; implying more money for past settlements (Ukraine team's approach)
- **Sensitivities:** Jacoby & Myers lawyers are very sensitive to compliance; must include their CYA footer language on all funnels

## Brand/Project Insights

### Claim Justice Now is the Consumer-Facing Brand
- **Insight:** While campaigns run for Jacoby & Myers (and Think Law), "Claim Justice Now" is the actual brand identity for lead capture
- **Evidence:** Danny setting up subdomains per state (claimjusticenow.com/california, /colorado, etc.)
- **Implication:** Tools like Case Builder should potentially live under Claim Justice Now umbrella

### Industry Differentiation Opportunity
- **Insight:** Competitors use tired tropes—gavels, leather-bound books, marble staircases
- **Evidence:** "I think there's even some white space where they don't use gavels... I know I could find a good way to play off that trope"
- **Implication:** Subverting or satirizing these tropes could create novelty

### Ad Fatigue Management is Critical
- **Insight:** Facebook algorithm requires constant rotation even on working content
- **Evidence:** "Once you reach KPI there's ad fatigue... very very important especially with Facebook's algorithm to make slight changes even if it's like for a script that's working"
- **Implication:** Need weekly rotation strategy; slight variations on winners

### Click-Through Rates Exceptionally High with Pattern Interrupts
- **Insight:** Danny's ads performing 900% above average CTR
- **Evidence:** "Look how good my click-through rate is it's performing nine hundred percent greater than like your average. I think it's because I have a hot shake in there."
- **Implication:** Motion/attention-grabbing first frame is crucial

### Once Targeted, Users Get Flooded
- **Insight:** After engaging with one accident ad, users receive hundreds from competitors
- **Evidence:** "Once you engage with one of these things you get like a hundred of them... how do you stand out in the sea"
- **Implication:** Speed to contact is critical; differentiation in the flood matters; first-touch advantage

## Risks and Concerns

### Compliance Risk: Ukraine Team's Approach
- **Risk:** Previous creative implied getting clients "more than what you were paid" — targeting wrong audience and wrong message
- **Flagged by:** Danny
- **Mitigation discussed:** Stopped those ads; should target people who *just* had accidents and were *injured*, not post-settlement

### Platform Risk: Ad Rejection
- **Risk:** Ads get rejected when not marked as Special Ad Category
- **Flagged by:** Danny
- **Mitigation discussed:** Always mark as Special Ad Category; if you find a workaround, great, but don't count on it

### Context Window Degradation
- **Risk:** AI chat performance degrades as context fills up
- **Flagged by:** Davis
- **Mitigation discussed:** Summarize thread and paste into new chat to refresh context window

## Key Quotes Worth Preserving

> **Danny on differentiation:** "If we're just competing we're racing to the bottom by just saying bullshit that everyone else does, we're not gonna really learn anything."

> **Danny on creative freedom:** "The most important thing is that we're calling out our avatar... but beyond that you could be as outlandish as you want."

> **Danny on industry competition:** "The rest of the internet in the industry is not really playing there [TikTok]... these people are dinosaurs."

> **Danny on copywriting:** "I would even say having a good copywriter on the team... I think you'll be a comedy writer. I think you'll be the killer."

> **Davis on the AI system:** "I can get you set up in cursor and I just have it as a git pull push so you could just basically git pull it with one button and you would have access to this entire bot."
