# Call Prep: Max Barry — Lead Source Vendor (Insiders Group)

> **Date:** February 18, 2026  
> **Contact:** Max Barry (member of the Insiders Group — Danny's paid community)  
> **Purpose:** Evaluate Max as a potential lead supplier — understand his product, pricing, quality, and whether it makes sense to buy from him  
> **Who's On the Call:** Davis, Danny (and/or Sasha)

---

## Context

Max Barry is a lead seller operating within the Insiders Group, the paid community Danny is part of. Being in the same community means we have more leverage to ask direct, candid questions than we would with a cold vendor — use that. He's not a stranger. This isn't a sales pitch from us; it's a vendor qualification call.

Our current model: we generate our own exclusive MVA leads through Meta ads → Claim Justice Now quiz funnel → deliver to clients (Jacoby & Meyers, etc.) at ~$300/lead. If Max's leads are quality and priced right, they could let us scale volume or test new geos without waiting on our own ad spend to ramp.

The key questions below are organized by priority. Don't try to cover everything — hit the most important ones, then go deeper where the answers get interesting.

## The Most Important Things to Establish

Before any other detail, confirm these three things early in the call. If any of them are deal-breakers, you'll know fast:

1. **Are the leads exclusive, or is he selling the same lead to multiple buyers?**
2. **How fresh are the leads? Are they real-time or aged?**
3. **What states is he selling leads for, and can he go metro-level if we need it?**

---

## Questions by Category

---

### 1. Where He Gets His Leads (The Source)

This is the most important thing to understand. The quality of a lead traces directly back to how it was generated.

- **Where are these leads coming from?** (His own ads? Aggregator he buys from? Partner publishers?)
- **What platform/channel generates them?** (Meta, Google, TikTok, organic, something else?)
- **Is he running his own funnels or buying from a network?** (If he's buying from someone else, ask who — and why we shouldn't just go direct)
- **Does he generate them himself end-to-end, or is he reselling?**
- What does the consumer-facing side look like — what ad does someone see, what form do they fill out?
- Is there a website or landing page we can look at?

> Why this matters: If he's buying from a network and reselling, the leads are likely shared and the quality is lower. If he's generating his own through paid social, we can evaluate whether his funnel is comparable to ours.

---

### 2. Exclusivity

- **Are these exclusive leads?** Meaning, are they sold to only one buyer per lead?
- If not exclusive — **how many firms get the same lead at the same time?**
- Is there any form of exclusivity option, even if it costs more?
- **Are these leads currently being sold to any firms that compete with our clients?** (e.g., Jacoby & Meyers, Larry H. Parker, or any firm in a state we're working)
- If we buy, does he guarantee he won't sell the same lead to another buyer?

> Why this matters: Exclusive leads convert at 20–60% vs. 5–15% for shared. At $300/lead, we need exclusivity. This is a potential dealbreaker.

---

### 3. Lead Freshness / Age

- **When are these leads generated, and how fast are they delivered?**
- Are they **real-time leads** (delivered within seconds/minutes of form submission)?
- Or are they **aged leads** (sitting for days, weeks, or longer before being sold)?
- If aged — exactly how old are they? (7 days, 30 days, 60+?)
- At what age does the price drop, and by how much?
- How does he ensure leads haven't already been contacted by multiple firms before they get to us?

> Why this matters: Lead freshness is directly tied to conversion. A real-time exclusive lead that we call within 60 seconds converts at 3–8x the rate of a lead that's been sitting for even a few hours. Aged leads can still work, but need to be priced accordingly (industry norm: $5–$20/lead for 60–90 day aged).

---

### 4. Geography — States, Metros, and Targeting

- **Which states is he currently selling leads for?**
- Can he sell leads for our primary states: **California, Colorado, Nevada, Washington?**
- Can he also do **North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi** (paused states we may reactivate)?
- Can he target by **metro area** (e.g., LA, San Diego, Las Vegas, Denver) or is it **state-wide only?**
- Can he filter by **ZIP code or county?**
- How consistent is lead volume by state? (e.g., Can he reliably deliver 20 leads/week in California?)
- Are some states more expensive than others? (CA and NY tend to be premium — what's his pricing difference by state?)

> Why this matters: Metro-level targeting matters for attorney client fit. A firm in Las Vegas doesn't want leads from rural Nevada. Knowing whether he can get that granular tells us a lot about his tech infrastructure.

---

### 5. Injury Type and Lead Data Fields

- **What type of accidents are these leads from?** (MVA only? Or does he also have slip & fall, workers' comp, mass tort?)
- Within MVA: **Can he filter by accident type?** (car-on-car, truck/commercial vehicle, motorcycle, rideshare, pedestrian?)
- **What injury types come with the leads?** Is there any self-reported injury severity?
- **What data fields come with each lead?**
  - Name, phone, email — always included?
  - Accident date?
  - Injury description?
  - Medical treatment status (did they see a doctor)?
  - Liability/fault information?
  - Insurance on the at-fault party (confirmed or unknown)?
  - Whether they already have an attorney?
  - Police report filed?
- Are leads **pre-screened for representation status** (i.e., no current attorney)?
- Are leads screened for statute of limitations (accident within 2–3 years)?

> Why this matters: The more data fields, the higher the lead quality. Documented medical treatment and clear liability are the biggest predictors of case value. We need to know exactly what we're getting before buying.

---

### 6. Lead Quality & Conversion

- **What conversion rates are his buyers seeing?** (Lead to signed case — ask for real numbers, not marketing speak)
- **What's his return/dispute rate?** How often do leads come back bad — disconnected numbers, wrong info, already represented, etc.?
- **Does he have any data on case outcomes?** Do his leads actually turn into settled cases, or do they fall apart at intake?
- Has he gotten feedback from his buyers about what's working and what's not?
- **What percentage of his leads have verified phone numbers?** (Are the phones real and working?)
- Does he screen out known TCPA litigators? (People who intentionally submit forms to generate lawsuits — real risk in this space)
- What's his fraud/junk rate? (Fake submissions, bots, people who deny ever submitting a form)

> Why this matters: This is where vendors either get real with you or go evasive. If he can cite actual conversion data from buyers, that's a good sign. If he deflects to "it depends on the firm," push back.

---

### 7. Pricing

- **What does he charge per lead?**
- Does price vary by:
  - State (CA vs. CO vs. NV)?
  - Exclusivity (exclusive vs. shared)?
  - Injury type or accident type?
  - Lead freshness (real-time vs. aged)?
- **Is there a bulk discount?** (e.g., if we commit to 50 leads/month, or 200 leads upfront)
- What's his minimum order — can we do a **trial batch of 10–20 leads** before committing to volume?
- **What's the pricing structure?** (Pay per lead? Monthly subscription? Prepay for a batch?)
- Is there a contract / commitment period, or is it month-to-month / pay-as-you-go?
- Any setup fees?

> Benchmark context (internal, don't share): Industry range for exclusive MVA form leads is $150–$500/lead. Our cost target is $100–$150 CPL to maintain margin at our $300 selling price. If his leads are priced above $150, we need them to be meaningfully higher quality or we're buying at thin/no margin.

---

### 8. Volume & Consistency

- **How many leads can he deliver per month per state?**
- Is volume consistent month over month, or does it fluctuate heavily?
- **Is he capacity-constrained?** (i.e., if we wanted to double our order, could he fulfill it?)
- Does he have any exclusivity agreements with other buyers that would limit what he can sell us?
- During slow periods (like January–February, which is naturally slower for PI), does his volume drop significantly?
- **What's his lead cap per state?** Can he set a daily or weekly cap so we don't get flooded?

---

### 9. Delivery & Technology

- **How does he deliver leads?** (Email? API/webhook to our CRM? SMS? A portal we log into?)
- How fast is delivery after a lead submits their form?
- Can he integrate with our stack? (We use Make.com and HeyFlow — does he have API access or webhook delivery?)
- Does he offer a dashboard or reporting portal where we can see leads in real-time?
- **Is there a CRM integration option?** (Clio, PracticePanther, MyCase — if we ever want to pass leads directly to attorney clients)
- What does a sample lead data package look like — can he send us an anonymized example?

---

### 10. Returns & Dispute Policy

- **What's his return policy?**
- What qualifies for a credit or refund? (Disconnected number? Already represented? Wrong state? No accident?)
- What does **not** qualify for a return?
- How do we dispute a lead — what's the process and turnaround time for resolution?
- Is there a time window for submitting return claims? (24 hours? 72 hours? 7 days?)
- **Does he offer credits or refunds?** (Credits toward future leads are standard; cash refunds are rare)

---

### 11. TCPA Compliance

- **How does he collect consent from the consumer?**
- Is consent collected at the point of form submission?
- Is it a one-to-one consent model (consumer consents to being contacted by one specific firm), or a broader consent (agrees to be contacted by multiple providers)?
- Is the consent language documented in the lead record?
- How does he handle TCPA risk if a lead claims they never submitted a form?
- Does he scrub against known TCPA litigator databases before selling leads?

> Why this matters: TCPA exposure is real. A single TCPA lawsuit can cost $500–$1,500 per violation. If his consent practices are sloppy, we're the ones who eat the liability when our clients call the leads.

---

### 12. Relationship & Terms

- Has he sold leads to anyone else in the Insiders Group? What was their experience?
- **Can he provide any references** — even just "ask [person] in the group"?
- Is he open to a trial period before we commit to anything?
- What does the relationship look like long-term — is he building this as a real business, or is it more of a side operation?
- How responsive is he when something goes wrong — how do we reach him?

---

## If He Pushes Back or Gets Vague

Some vendors get defensive or vague on quality questions. Here's how to handle it:

**"It depends on the firm's intake process"** → "Understood. What conversion rates are your best buyers seeing? Your worst?"

**"I can't share conversion data"** → "Can you share anything? Even directional? We just need to know if it's worth a trial."

**"The leads are fresh"** → "How fresh exactly? What's the average time between form submission and delivery to the buyer?"

**"They're exclusive"** → "Great — is that guaranteed in writing? And does that mean no other buyer, or just no other buyer in the same firm?"

**"My buyers are happy"** → "Would any of them be willing to do a quick reference call?"

---

## What a Good Outcome Looks Like

We leave this call with:
- [ ] Clear understanding of where his leads come from
- [ ] Confirmed whether they're exclusive (or not)
- [ ] Exact pricing per lead, by state
- [ ] A sense of what data fields we get with each lead
- [ ] Agreement on a **trial batch** (10–20 leads) before any larger commitment
- [ ] His return policy in writing (or at least verbally confirmed)
- [ ] A gut read on whether he's a serious operator or someone reselling network leads

**Don't commit to a large volume on the first call.** Propose a test batch. See how the leads perform in the real world before scaling.

---

## What a Bad Outcome Looks Like

- He can't explain where the leads come from ("they come from various sources")
- He can't or won't share any conversion data
- The leads are shared (sold to 3+ buyers) at a similar price to exclusive
- He doesn't have a real return policy
- Consent collection is vague or he dismisses TCPA questions
- No trial option — he wants a large upfront commitment

If any of these come up, it doesn't mean we walk away — but we don't commit volume until we've run a test batch and seen results ourselves.
