## Summary

The meeting focused on logistics, campaign performance, and strategy for Lead Faucet. Daniel Dilworth reported strong performance from a new "play" campaign and emphasized the immediate need for cash flow. Key strategic discussions included Davis Ballard's proposal for prioritizing 10 ad sets based on psychological triggers, Daniel Dilworth's segmentation of the Trello boards for better workflow, and the shared goal of hitting 50 leads per state for Jacoby & Meyers in Washington, Colorado, Nevada, and California. The team agreed on launching a refresh campaign targeting personal injury attorneys using UGC video ads, focusing on Meta platforms, and discussed implementing a sophisticated compliance system, developing case studies as social proof, and exploring organic content and the more lucrative "live transfer" lead generation model.

## Key Decisions Made

### Campaign Performance & Cash Flow
- New "play" campaign performing well: **10 leads at $150/day** since Friday
- Immediate focus is on cash flow to ensure team gets paid and initiate "virtuous flywheel"
- Success metric: **CPL at half the payment received** (many competitors spend more than they earn)

### Lead Goals
- **Target: 50 leads per state** for Jacoby & Meyers
- **Active States:** Washington, Colorado, Nevada, California
- **Expansion Targets:** Northeast tri-state areas (New York, Pennsylvania) — leveraging Sasha's regional knowledge

### Trello Board Segmentation (4 Boards)
1. **Lead Faucet Agency Brand Work** — overarching agency tasks
2. **CRM Board** — tracking viable leads from HeyFlow tool
3. **Claim Justice Now Brand** — tools and related work
4. **Client Backlogs** — firm-specific (Jacoby & Meyers, Sync Law)

### Client Acquisition Campaign Strategy
- **First priority:** Launch refresh campaign targeting personal injury attorneys specializing in MVA
- **Format:** UGC video ads
- **Platform:** Meta (Facebook and Instagram)
- **Budget:** $150 daily ad spend
- **Creative Approach:** 2-3 variations to start, managed in "Play" tool
- **Funnel captures:** Firm size, marketing budget, current lead gen providers, #1 challenge

### Creative Strategy
- AI-generated UGC videos that **don't appear AI-made**
- Combine motion elements with still concepts for better feed performance
- Intentionally use "sloppier" or "ugly" creatives — looks more unfiltered, performs better
- Avatar recommendation: Use a "pretty girl" who looks relatable for targeting lawyers in the Northeast

## Strategic Initiatives Discussed

### Organic Content Strategy
- Davis advocated for using lessons learned from paid ads to create organic content, particularly on **TikTok**
- Significant untapped market that can offset paid media costs
- Generic landing page to gather state information if routing based on location proves difficult for organic traffic

### Compliance System ("Saul Bot")
- Sophisticated compliance system checking against:
  - State-specific rules
  - Approved/banned phrases
  - Behavioral copy triggers
- Assigns a **"risk score"**
- Helps team intelligently operate within the "gray area" of compliance
- Pull on emotional triggers without risking client relationship

### User Research Initiative
- Run ads to recruit lawyers or accident victims for quick 30-minute user studies
- **Incentive:** $50 Amazon gift card
- Purpose: Qualitative interviews to avoid operating "in a vacuum"
- Learn what makes them scroll past an ad

### Case Studies as Social Proof
- Develop "nice case studies" to support sales process
- Allude to clients by name (e.g., "West Coast client")
- Highlight successful results
- Large law firms typically work with multiple lead gen providers — not exclusive

### Live Transfer Model (Future)
- Potentially more lucrative lead generation model
- Clients pay **~$1,500 per call transfer** through call center
- Can potentially build out system using an AI agent

---

## Compensation Structure Discussed

- Based on **percentage of net profit** after campaign hits targets
- **50% allocated to agency** after hitting 50% ads / 50% profit split
- Paid **in perpetuity for every re-buy**
- Grows the collective "pie" as more clients added
- Encourages collective effort

---

## Funnel Optimization

- Davis to audit form funnel to implement:
  - **Gamification**
  - **Psychological principles** — easier questions first to build momentum
  - Increase completion rates
- Daniel exploring India-based team for state-specific routing within funnel
- Currently leaning towards manually sending leads to protect Jacoby & Meyers relationship

---

## Success Metrics & Goals

### Short-Term
- Sign another firm before end of January
- Get ads for client acquisition launched over the weekend
- With consistent leads, success becomes a numbers game

### Business Dashboard
- Track ad buys, new clients, general business health
- "You can't manage what you don't measure"
- Providing dashboard access could be a differentiator

### Benchmark Reference
- Max (sales guy) achieved $100K booked revenue in month 1
- Doubled in month 2
- Added 30% in month 3

---

## Competitive Landscape & Risks

- **Cutthroat environment** in lead generation space
- Risk of competitors using "bot farms" to run up advertising bills
- Compliant ad strategy focuses on delivering a **strength report before asking for contact info**
- Providing actual claim estimates is **illegal**
