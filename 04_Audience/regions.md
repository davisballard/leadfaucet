## Geo-Localized Creative Strategy

Danny's approach: **Same messaging, swap out location.**

1. Create base creative with state-neutral messaging
2. Use AI to generate state-specific imagery (landmarks, recognizable locations)
3. Swap backgrounds while keeping core ad structure
4. Deploy via state-specific subdomains

**Example:** Same avatar, same script → Nevada gets Strip background, Washington gets Seattle skyline.

## State-Specific Campaign Checklist

When targeting a specific state:

1. [ ] Check state Bar advertising rules
2. [ ] Verify partner firm is licensed in that state
3. [ ] Add any state-required disclosures
4. [ ] If California: Apply SB37 tone restrictions
5. [ ] Confirm consent language includes state-licensed firm
6. [ ] Create state-localized imagery
7. [ ] Set up state subdomain (claimjusticenow.com/[state])

## Special Ad Category Restrictions

**All personal injury ads fall under Meta Special Ad Categories:**

❌ Cannot target:
- Age
- Interests (e.g., "interested in personal injury lawyers")
- Custom audiences based on health/injury signals
- Lookalikes built on injury lead data

✅ Can target:

- Broad age range (18+)

**Strategy:** Let the creative do the qualifying. Call out avatar in first 3 seconds.
