## Team Structure

| Team Member | Role | Focus Area |
|-------------|------|------------|
| **Daniel Dilworth** | Lead / Operations | Media buying, tools, client relationships, strategic direction |
| **Davis Ballard** | Creative & AI Systems | Ad creative, scripts, compliance engine, funnel optimization |
| **Alex Kiss** | Sales & Regional | Lead scrubbing, CRM, Northeast expansion, client rapport |

---

## Priority #1: Client Acquisition Campaign (NEW)

**First priority from Jan 21 meeting:**
> Launch a refresh campaign targeting personal injury attorneys using UGC video ads on Meta.

### What This Means:
- Create UGC video ad scripts for attracting PI firms (MVA specialization)
- Scripts can be state-specific or generalized
- Generate 2-3 creative variations for initial $150/day spend
- Funnel captures: firm size, marketing budget, current lead gen providers, #1 challenge

### Creative Guidelines:
1. **AI-generated UGC that doesn't look AI-made** — maximize click-through rates
2. **Combine motion elements with still concepts** — better feed performance
3. **Intentionally "sloppy" or "ugly" creatives** — looks unfiltered, doesn't look like an ad
4. **Use "Play" tool** for managing creative backlog

---

## Priority #2: Ad Set Strategy & Behavioral Triggers

**Daniel's direction:**
> "Using behavioral triggers like loss aversion and urgency is key to applying successful strategies across different states, potentially with varied copy or creative."

### What This Means:
- Develop 10 prioritized ad sets derived from research and positioning
- Focus on psychological triggers for iterative learning
- Test different angles with small budgets to quickly identify best performers
- Track which psychological triggers drive performance

### Key Triggers to Test:
- Loss aversion ("Don't lose your rights")
- Urgency (time-sensitive windows)
- Authority markers (earned authority > claimed authority)
- Moral framing (insurance companies as villains)

---

## Priority #3: Funnel Optimization

**Davis's initiative:**
> "Audit the form funnel to implement gamification and psychological principles."

### What This Means:
- Present easier questions first to build momentum
- Increase completion rates through micro-commitments
- Add gamification elements
- Ensure questions progress from easiest to hardest

### State-Specific Routing:
- Daniel exploring India-based team for implementation
- Currently leaning toward manual routing to protect Jacoby & Meyers relationship

---

## Priority #4: Organic Content Strategy

**New focus from Jan 21 meeting:**
> Use lessons learned from paid ads to create organic content, particularly on TikTok.

### What This Means:
- Research legality of routing organic traffic by user's state
- Consistently post on Claim Justice Now profiles
- Create generic landing page if geo-routing is technically difficult
- Significant untapped market to offset paid media costs

---

## Priority #5: Compliance Engine (Saul Bot)

**Daniel's endorsement:**
> "A sophisticated compliance system that checks against state-specific rules, approved/banned phrases, and behavioral copy triggers."

### Requirements:
- Create Saul bot in Slack
- Provide access to Daniel and Alex for compliance checks and brainstorming
- Assign "risk score" to copy
- Help team intelligently operate within "gray area" of compliance
- Pull on emotional triggers without risking client relationship

### States to Cover:
| Client | States |
|--------|--------|
| Jacoby & Meyers | California (SB37!), Colorado, Nevada, Washington |
| Expansion | Northeast tri-state (NY, PA) |

---

## Priority #6: Social Proof & Credibility

**Alex's recommendation:**
> "Develop nice case studies to support the sales process."

### What This Means:
- Create Google Doc for collective experience (all brands/logos worked with)
- Develop case studies that allude to clients ("West Coast client")
- Add team page to website to differentiate from competitors
- Highlight successful results

---

## Priority #7: Iterative Learning System

**Build the AI system so it learns from every campaign.**

### System Components:
1. **Performance database** — store ad copy with metrics
2. **Behavioral trigger tracking** — which triggers work where
3. **Do's and Don'ts** — learned rules from what works/fails
4. **Report analysis** — AI reads reports, extracts learnings, updates memory

### Recursive Loop:
```
Create Content → Run Ads → Analyze Performance → Extract Learnings → Update Database → Create Better Content
```

---

## What Success Looks Like

### For the Team:
- Cash flow established via virtuous flywheel
- 50 leads per state for Jacoby & Meyers
- Sign another firm before end of January
- System that gets smarter over time

### Metrics That Matter:
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| CPL | Half of payment received |
| Leads per state | 50 (recurring goal) |
| New firm signups | 1 by end of January |
| Organic traffic | Offsetting paid costs |

---

## Compensation Structure

- Based on **percentage of net profit** after campaign
- **50% allocated to agency** after hitting 50% ads / 50% profit target
- Paid **in perpetuity for every re-buy**
- Grows the collective "pie" as more clients added
- Encourages collective effort across team

---

- Media buying/ad spend management (Daniel handles)
- Lead scrubbing/CRM management (Alex handles)
