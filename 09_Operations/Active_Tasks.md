## 💰 BUSINESS MODEL RECAP

### Revenue Model
- **Clients prepay** for lead batches (e.g., 50 leads)
- **Fulfillment obligation:** Must deliver or risk refund
- **Backup plan:** Buy leads from Max/Kieran at margin (buy $150-250, sell $350)
- **Goal:** Generate own leads via ads to keep full margin

### Compensation Structure
- **20% of net profit** to whoever signs the client
- **In perpetuity** (as long as client is active)
- **Separate from** any equity arrangement
- **Example:** $20K buy → 50% margin = $10K net → $2K to salesperson per month

### "One Firm Per Metro" Model
- Exclusive territory positioning
- Fear of loss: "Use us before someone else in your market does"
- When prospect applies, system checks if metro is taken
- Creates urgency + premium positioning

### Verticals
1. **Personal Injury** (primary focus)
2. **Immigration** (secondary)
3. **Mass Tort** (third)

**Key differentiator:** "We don't just generate demand, we build the tools that capture it"
