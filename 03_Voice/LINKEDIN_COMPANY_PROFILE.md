Most lead gen companies force a choice: volume or quality. High case counts or the right cases. The attorneys we work with are done making that trade.

Lead Faucet is exclusive legal lead generation for PI law firms — built on the premise that a lead isn't worth much if it wastes your intake team's time. We call our standard Case-Ready Leads. Every lead that leaves us — soft tissue that keeps the lights on, rideshare and trucking accidents that build the firm — is held to that standard before it reaches your phone.

What does that standard look like in practice?

Better creative attracts people who actually had an accident and are actually looking for help. Tighter quiz funnels screen out the noise before intake ever gets involved. And at the top of that standard, two proprietary consumer tools that no other legal lead gen company has built: CaseSnapshot, a free AI-assisted documentation tool for MVA victims that generates a professional case PDF before the attorney picks up the phone — and GetMyVisa, a multi-language guided intake experience for immigration applicants across 12 visa categories. Both tools capture demand upstream of everything else in the category. The claimant has already documented their situation before they ever searched for a lawyer.

What it means for a partner firm: soft tissue volume you can count on, intentional targeting for the high-value cases that change trajectory, and the documentation that makes intake a real conversation instead of a qualification gamble.

One firm per market. No exceptions.

**Who we work with:** Personal injury firms — MVA, rideshare, commercial trucking, TBI, wrongful death — immigration practices building a predictable intake pipeline, and mass tort firms that need high-volume qualification for MDL litigation.

## Notes for Execution

- "Case-Ready Leads" is always capitalized — it's a proper mechanism name, not a descriptor
- CaseSnapshot and GetMyVisa are always named together when referencing the tools. Never name one without the other.
- The About copy avoids implying Case-Ready only applies to tool-generated leads — the standard applies to every lead, including soft tissue quiz-funnel leads
- "One firm per market" is a standalone line. The period and line break are intentional — Ed's rhythm.
- Do not add buzzwords like "game-changing," "revolutionary," or "cutting-edge"
